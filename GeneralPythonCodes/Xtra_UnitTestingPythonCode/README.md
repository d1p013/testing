# Unit Testing Python Code

Once you have created a Python module, it is a good practice to write Unit Tests for the functions defined in the module. The builtin module `unittest` allows you to write explicit tests for all your functions quite efficiently.

In this directory, there are two `.py` files, as follows.
- `division.py` : Defines three different functions for division.
- `test_division.py` : Writes unit-tests for the division module.
