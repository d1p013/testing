# Command-Line Arguments

One may execute the Python 3 scripts in this directory using the following command right from the command-line.

`python <filename>.py`   |   e.g., `python checkPassword_v1.py`    

where `<filename>` is the name of the `.py` file, as in the example above.      
You may have to run `python3 <filename>.py` if you have Python 2 as default on your system.

If you have any command-line argument parsed in your Python 3 code (like `checkPassword_v4.py` in this directory), you will need to pass the command-line argument(s) to your code while running it. You may run the script as follows in such a scenario.

`python <filename>.py --<flag>=<argument>`   |   e.g., `python checkPassword_v4.py --pass=Sourav@NTU`          

where `<filename>` is the name of the `.py` file, `<flag>` is the flag, and `<argument>` is the corresponding argument.
